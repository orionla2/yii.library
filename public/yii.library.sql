Like half the planet. Birthdate: Jan. 3, 1954. I spent a couple of years in Brooklyn, but have really only one clear recollection&mdash;of being bitten by my upstairs friend/neighbor, John H&mdash;. I lived briefly in Central Islip and Massapequa, but mostly grew up in Freeport, Long Island, a suburb of New York City, and had three main pursuits: climbing tall trees, riding my bike to the far reaches of the island (typically without my parents&rsquo; knowledge), and body-surfing at Jones Beach (field no. 9). At first I wanted to be a New Yorker cartoonist. For a year or so during my junior-high years I sent my work to the magazine. I seem to recall my cartoons being returned within 24 hours, though surely that can&rsquo;t be the case. Next I wrote a novel. It was 75 pages long and had a sex scene, even though I had no idea what sex was. I loved it when I got to stay home from school for a cold or some other illness. Yes, once I feigned being ill by putting the thermometer under the hot-water faucet. When I think about it now I&rsquo;m pretty sure my mother guessed, because a 112-degree F temperature is pretty high. When I did get to stay home from school I read the Dumas brothers and drew things. I drew for hours and hours on end. I did have a high-school girlfriend, Michelle G&mdash;-, who in fact shaped my destiny. It was because of her that I went to the University of Pennsylvania. She dumped me two weeks later. This was hard. I recovered. She undumped me. We dated another six months. Then she dumped me again. But I was happy. I studied Russian, learned to drink vodka from a real Russian prince, fought acne by wearing underwear on my head to keep the hair off my face, and graduated Summa Cum Laude. My first job was in New York as an editorial assistant, meaning gopher, for a publisher in New York. On the way to my interview I stopped in Penn Station to use the men&rsquo;s room. When I flushed the john, out came a spume of blue water. I got the job anyway, a pity hire, clearly. But I enjoyed the work. Two editors fought over me, not because I was particuarly talented or good looking, but because they hated each other and had offices with big glass windows that faced each other across a narrow corridor, which only amplified their hatred. I became their pawn. Each would sit me down in front of the big glass window and try to be charming, so that the other saw and suspected that gossip was being traded. This was hard until I caught on. Then it became fun, and again I was happy.

I went to journalism grad school at Columbia University. On one of my first assignments I was standing under the West Side Highway when a pigeon, or possibly a large goose, crapped down the face of my new London Fog raincoat. I didn&rsquo;t know it until I began conducting man-on-the-street interviews and one of my subjects kindly pointed out that I stunk like hell and should go look at myself in a fucking mirror. On graduation day former-mayor John Lindsay was sitting in the row behind my family. At the conclusion of the ceremony, my mother stood up and told him he was the handsomest man she had ever met.

I tried as much as possible to avoid the main mission of the journal, which was to write business news, and concentrated instead on feature stories for Page One. My favorite: A story on video-dating that caused Bob Woodward to launch an investigation of me. So there WAS something that Nixon and I had in common. I hit it off so well with one of my video women that we ended up dating for about nine months. In the story I called her Emily; after it ran I received maybe 500 letters, including at least one marriage proposal.

At some point I grew tired of writing journalism. One day the managing editor summoned me to New York, to a breakfast at Windows on the World in the World Trade Center, where I knew he planned to offer me a job as bureau chief in one of the paper&rsquo;s key bureaus. I told him no. Soon afterward, I got married&mdash;blind date, of all things&mdash;and my wife and I moved to Baltimore, where I wrote a couple of unpublished novels, did some respectable free-lance pieces, helped raise some babies, and wrote my first book,<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></span><em style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Myriad Pro&quot;, Myriad, Tahoma, Geneva, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 26px; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">The Naked Consumer</em><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Myriad Pro&quot;, Myriad, Tahoma, Geneva, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 26px; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">, about how companies spied on individual consumers.

It can now be revealed that the SAS never was dissolved: it lived on, commanded personally by Churchill and hidden even from the British government. They were tasked with hunting through the ruins of the Reich for the SS commanders responsible for the murder of their comrades, including many who had escaped the failed justice of the Nuremberg trials. Along the way, they discovered before anyone else the full horror of Hitler&#39;s regime, and the growing threat from Stalin&#39;s Russia. Still studied by the SAS today and a central part of their founding myth, the story of the Nazi hunters is now told by bestselling author Damien Lewis.</span></p>\r\n');

With most of their animals killed, or stolen away to Berlin, zookeepers Jan and Antonina Zabinski begin smuggling Jews into the empty cages. As the war escalates Jan becomes increasingly involved in the anti-Nazi resistance. Ammunition is buried in the elephant enclosure and explosives stored in the animal hospital. Plans are prepared for what will become the Warsaw uprising. Through the ever-present fear of discovery, Antonina must keep her unusual household afloat, caring for both its human and animal inhabitants - otters, a badger, hyena pups, lynxes - as Europe crumbles around them. Written with the narrative drive and emotional punch of a novel, The Zookeeper&#39;s Wife is a remarkable true story. It shows us the human and personal impact of war - of life in the Warsaw Ghetto, of fighting in the anti-Nazi resistance. But more than anything it is a story of decency and sacrifice triumphing over terror and oppression. Jan and Antonina saved over 300 people from the death camps of the Holocaust. It has already been acclaimed by Jonathan Safran Foer: &#39;I can&#39;t imagine a better story or storyteller. The Zookeeper&#39;s Wife will touch every nerve you have.&#39;</span></p>\r\n');

Strangers to each other, they were newly pregnant, and facing an uncertain fate without their husbands. Alone, scared, and with so many loved ones already lost to the Nazis, these young women were privately determined to hold on to all they had left: their lives, and those of their unborn babies. That the gas chambers ran out of Zyklon-B just after the babies were born, before they and their mothers could be exterminated, is just one of several miracles that allowed them all to survive and rebuild their lives after World War II. Born Survivors follows the mothers&#39; incredible journey - first to Auschwitz, where they each came under the murderous scrutiny of Dr. Josef Mengele; then to a German slave labour camp where, half-starved and almost worked to death, they struggled to conceal their condition; and finally, as the Allies closed in, their hellish 17-day train journey with thousands of other prisoners to the Mauthausen death camp in Austria. Hundreds died along the way but the courage and kindness of strangers, including guards and civilians, helped save these women and their children. Sixty-five years later, the three &#39;miracle babies&#39; met for the first time at Mauthausen for the anniversary of the liberation that ultimately saved them. United by their remarkable experiences of survival against all odds, they now consider each other &quot;siblings of the heart.&quot; In Born Survivors, Wendy Holden brings all three stories together for the first time to mark their seventieth birthdays and the seventieth anniversary of the ending of the war. A heart-stopping account of how three mothers and their newborns fought to survive the Holocaust, Born Survivors is also a life-affirming celebration of our capacity to care and to love amid inconceivable cruelty.</span></p>\r\n');

A young woman&#39;s struggle to save her family and her soul during the extraordinary year of 1666, when plague suddenly struck a small Derbyshire village. In 1666, plague swept through London, driving the King and his court to Oxford, and Samuel Pepys to Greenwich, in an attempt to escape contagion. The north of England remained untouched until, in a small community of leadminers and hill farmers, a bolt of cloth arrived from the capital. The tailor who cut the cloth had no way of knowing that the damp fabric carried with it bubonic infection. So begins the Year of Wonders, in which a Pennine village of 350 souls confronts a scourge beyond remedy or understanding. Desperate, the villagers turn to sorcery, herb lore, and murderous witch-hunting. Then, led by a young and charismatic preacher, they elect to isolate themselves in a fatal quarantine. The story is told through the eyes of Anna Frith who, at only 18, must contend with the death of her family, the disintegration of her society, and the lure of a dangerous and illicit attraction. Geraldine Brooks&#39;s novel explores love and learning, fear and fanaticism, and the struggle of 17th century science and religion to deal with a seemingly diabolical pestilence. &#39;Year of Wonders&#39; is also an eloquent memorial to the real-life Derbyshire villagers who chose to suffer alone during England&#39;s last great plague.</span></p>\r\n');

Dweck reveals what all great parents, teachers, CEOs, and athletes already know: how a simple idea about the brain can create a love of learning and a resilience that is the basis of great accomplishment in every area.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"border: 0px; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: latobold; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Praise for&nbsp;<i style=\"border: 0px; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Mindset</i></span><span style=\"font-family: latoregular; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Everyone should read this book.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"border: 0px; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: latobold; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Chip and Dan Heath, authors of&nbsp;<i style=\"border: 0px; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Switch</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i style=\"border: 0px; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Made to Stick</i></span><span style=\"font-family: latoregular; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">&nbsp;Will prove to be one of the most influential books ever about motivation.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"border: 0px; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: latobold; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Po Bronson, author of&nbsp;<i style=\"border: 0px; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">NurtureShock</i></span><span style=\"font-family: latoregular; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">&nbsp;A good book is one whose advice you believe.

In the wake of her mother&#39;s rapid death from cancer, her family disbanded and her marriage crumbled. With nothing to lose, she made the most impulsive decision of her life: to walk eleven-hundred miles of the west coast of America - from the Mojave Desert, through California and Oregon, and into Washington state - and to do it alone. She had no experience of long-distance hiking and the journey was nothing more than a line on a map. But it held a promise - a promise of piecing together a life that lay in ruins at her feet. Strayed&#39;s account captures the agonies - both mental and physical - of her incredible journey; how it maddened and terrified her, and how, ultimately, it healed her.

Her agent told her not to get on the plane. The male leads weren&#39;t even cast. The financing was shaky at best. The script had been re-written countless times. And yet something about Wild Oats lured Shirley MacLaine to the film&#39;s location shoot in the far-off Canary Islands-and straight to the center of one of the most thrilling and paradigm-shifting adventures of her life. The making of the film reads like a screwball comedy, as the cast and crew face unpredictable daily obstacles with ingenuity, grit, and personal sacrifice. Yet the chaos leads Shirley to a revelatory new understanding of the demise of one of history&#39;s most elusive yet endlessly intriguing places. Scholars have long theorized that Spain&#39;s Canary Islands are the remnants of the mighty lost continent of Atlantis. As the movie set descends into pandemonium, Shirley finds fascinating corollaries between the island&#39;s cataclysmic fate and our own dangerous trajectory. Can we learn the lessons the citizens of Atlantis failed to comprehend? The answer is borne out of recovered memories from Shirley&#39;s past life on Atlantis and through a series of meditations that reveal the necessity of unfettered imagination when looking for bold new truths, rendering this evocative memoir essential reading for anyone seeking a broader understanding of what it means to be human-both where we came from and where we are going.</span></p>\r\n');
